# Notes for using the Github
To begin with, I am going to briefly introduce Git.
Git is a free and open source control version system.

Then, you might ask, what is "version control"?
Version control is the way that a programmer tracks his or her code changes.
We can look back at all the changes we have made over time.
If needed, we can always go back to the original version.

Terms involved
Directory - > folder
Terminal or Command line - > interface for text commands
CLI - > command line interface
cd - > change directory
Code Editor - > word processor for writing code
Repository - > project or a folder/place where you projects are kept
Github - > A website to host your repositories online.

Git Commands
Clone -> bring a repository hosted somewhere like in Github into a folder on your local machine.
add -> track your files and changes in Git
commit -> save your files in Git
push -> upload Git commits to a remote repo, like Github
pull -> the opposite of push, download changes from remote repo to your local machine
